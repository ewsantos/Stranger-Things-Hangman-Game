# Hangman-Game
This is my hangman game for class.

Pseudo code
1 - words to guess in array
2 - number of guesses = 10
3 - array of guessed letters [] empty to start
4 - word ['_', '_'] have same number of elements as random from words to guess
5 - for loop that goes over word to guess length
6 - listen for keyup (letter) word to guess.indexof(letter), set to boolean = is the key pressed inside of word to guess? 
7 - for loop from 0 to length of word to guess
